Get Comfortable with Being uncomfortable
It's natural to feel uneasy when trying to learn something new. It's easy to give in when you feel uncertainty and
self-doubt, but be courageous. Tell yourself that you are safe and you are brave. Be as kind to yourself as you would be
to a friend. If you persist, the level of discomfort you may be feel will be reduced and in time will be replaced with
knowledge that you once did not have.
