            <h3>Hey Internet Cousin,</h3>

            <p>Are you scared right now? <em>I get it!</em> Your fear is not undounded. $2000 bucks for a program that
                will teach you the skills for a new career that offers higher pay and flexibiltiy?!? Sounds really
                sketch...but it isn't!! One you should be hella proud of yourself. Two , you're learning new skills thus
                making the internet more diverse and inclusive. Remember, even Bey said, "Not enough Black women had a
                seat at the table, so I had to chop down that wood and build my own table. Then I had to invite the best
                there was to have a seat. That meant hiring women, men, outsiders, underdogs. And I've been very proud
                to provide them with a place at my table."</p>

            <h3>If You Want My Advice...</h3>
            <h4>Be Gentle With Yourself</h4><!--center all h4 headings-->
            <p>Groundbreaking, I know. Honey, you are learning to read, write, and problem-solve in a new language all
                in 6 months. Give yourself a break! You are going to get this, I promise. <em>How do I know?</em>
                Because just last month, you were learning about HTML & CSS. You thought you would never get it. Look at
                you now.

            <h4>Just Walk Away</h4>
            <p>Not from the program, nah fam, we done already spent too much money!! I mean if you are stuck trying
                to
                figure out a problem: post the question in Slack, close the laptop, and go walk the fur baby. We
                both
                know that their head is getting heavy in your lap. I know you wanna grind it out but trust me, just
                walk
                away. The solution will be there in the morning.
            </p>
